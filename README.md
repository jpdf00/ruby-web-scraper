              Welcome to the Magic: The Gathering Web Scraper

 This tool is design to search for Magic: The Gatering cards based
 on their types and subtypes, and returns a list of matches.

 1.1 - You will be prompted to enter a Card Type or Supertype.
 This is mandatory and accepts any valid card type or supertype.

 Examples:

 `Chose a Card Type or Supertype: Creature`

 or

 `Chose a Card Type or Supertype: Legendary`

 1.2 - You will be prompted to chose if you want to Include or Exclude the previous entry.
 To Include enter "I". That will return only results that have that card Type or Supertype.
 To Exclude enter "E". That will return only results that do not have that card Type or Supertype.

 Examples:

 `Include or Exclude from the search? (I/E): I`

 or

 `Include or Exclude from the search? (I/E): E`

 1.3 - You will be prompted to chose if you want to enter another Type or Supertype
 To do so enter "Y". That will repeat this process
 To move to the next step enter "N". That will move to the next step

 Examples:

 `Want to add another? (Y/N): Y`

 or

 `Want to add another? (Y/N): N`

 2.1 - You will be prompted to enter a Card Subtype.
 This is not mandatory and accepts any value.
 Keep in mind that entering a value that do not match a valid Card Subtype an chosing to Include
 will result in an empty search.

 Examples:

 `Chose a Card Subtype: Dragon`

 or

 `Chose a Card Subtype: Cat`

 2.2 - You will be prompted to chose if you want to Include or Exclude the previous entry.
 To Include enter "I". That will return only results that have that card Subtype.
 To Exclude enter "E". That will return only results that do not have that card Subtype.

 Examples:

 `Include or Exclude from the search? (I/E): I`

 or

 `Include or Exclude from the search? (I/E): E`

 2.3 - You will be prompted to chose if you want to enter another Subtype
 To do so enter "Y". That will repeat this process
 To move to the next step enter "N". That will move to the next step

 Examples:

 `Want to add another? (Y/N): Y`

 or

 `Want to add another? (Y/N): N`
